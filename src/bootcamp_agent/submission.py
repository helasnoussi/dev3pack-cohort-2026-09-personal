"""Turn a chapter's result into a submission somebody else can check.

WHAT IS VERIFIABLE, AND WHAT IS NOT. This is the whole design, so it is stated
first.

  * `result` — which exercises passed, failed, or were never reached. This is a
    CLAIM in the file and a FACT after `scripts/verify_submission.py` re-runs the
    submitted notebook. The notebook is the arbiter, here as everywhere else.
  * `evidence.notebook_sha256` — binds the claim to one exact file, so nobody
    submits the score of one notebook next to a different notebook.
  * `help` — whether a hint or a reveal was taken. This comes from the learner's
    own machine and CANNOT be verified by re-running, because the progress
    database never leaves their laptop. It is on the honour system, and it only
    ever COSTS marks, so there is no incentive to over-report it. Under-reporting
    inflates a score by at most the help that was taken, which we accept.

WHY THERE IS NO SIGNATURE. A secret that ships to the learner's machine is not a
secret, so a locally-produced signature would prove only that our own code ran.
Verification happens by re-running the work, which is a stronger claim than any
signature we could issue here. The one HMAC in this course is on the certificate,
where the founder holds the key and signs at demo day.
