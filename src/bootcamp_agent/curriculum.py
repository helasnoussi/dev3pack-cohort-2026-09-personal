"""The course as data: fifteen sessions, twelve week-0 units, one capstone, and
where each one lives.

Before this module the schedule existed only as prose in `docs/curriculum.md`
and as directory names. Two sources drift, so this is the one: the CLI reads it
to find a notebook, `scripts/course_site.py` renders the table of contents and
the course index from it, and the publisher gates weeks by it.

LAYOUT. Every learner-facing page lives under `units/en/`, in the shape of the
Hugging Face courses: one directory per unit, its pages beside its notebook, and
one generated `_toctree.yml` that is the only place ordering is written down.
`en` is a real directory level so a second language is a mirror of this one.

Exercise ids are NOT listed here. They come from the registry in
:mod:`bootcamp_agent.checks`, because that is where a check is actually defined
and a list of ids kept anywhere else would be a second source of the same fact.

IDS WERE RENAMED ONCE, on 2026-09-09, when the sessions were re-sequenced and no
live-session submission existed yet. `docs/instructor/id-migration.md` records
the map. After that date an id is never renamed or reused.
