"""Fork, commit, push and open the pull request — so nobody has to know git.

    uv run bootcamp submit ch02 --github you --push

WHY THIS EXISTS, in one number. On day one 26 people forked the submissions
repository and 2 opened a pull request. Everything before this step worked for
them; the seven manual git commands after it did not. This is that step, as one
flag.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. It never touches the course repository, never force-
pushes, and never opens a pull request against anything but the submissions
repo. It re-uses an open pull request rather than stacking a second one, because
a learner re-submitting is the normal case and not a mistake.

HOW IT IS TESTED. Every git and gh call goes through one injected runner, so the
whole sequence can be driven offline against a fake and asserted command by
command. A flow whose only test is running it for real is a flow nobody dares
change.
