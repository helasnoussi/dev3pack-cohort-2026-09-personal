"""The tier above the floor: optional exercises that no denominator can see.

    from bootcamp_agent.bonus import bonus
    bonus("ch02", answer_with_timeout)

WHY A SEPARATE REGISTRY AND NOT `chNN-e9`. `curriculum.exercise_ids` collects
every key in `CHECKS` starting with the session's prefix, so an extra id there
would silently raise ch02 from 400 marks to 500 and make every finished
submission read as incomplete. Uncounted has to be true by CONSTRUCTION, not by
remembering to special-case it -- so these live in their own dict, which nothing
that computes a total ever reads.

WHAT MAKES A GOOD ONE. Every session already ships running and passing: that is
the floor, and it is deliberately reachable by everybody. A bonus is the part
that cannot be reached by running the cell you were given. It must be judged by
BEHAVIOUR rather than by prose, so that "I improved it" is decided by the code
and not by how confidently it was claimed.

AND IT SHIPS FAILING, on purpose. A bonus cell that passes as handed over has
nothing to demonstrate and nothing to earn.
