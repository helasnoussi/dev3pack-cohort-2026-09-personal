"""The track: who handed in what, and what it was worth.

A PURE FOLD OVER THE SUBMISSIONS TREE. Given the merged bundles, this produces
the track and nothing else produces it. Regenerating from a clean checkout must
reproduce the same bytes, which is what makes the rendered files safe to commit:
if they ever differ, the submissions are right and the rendered file was stale.

WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It does not open a notebook. It parses `submission.json` and
reads the curriculum, and that is the whole of its diet. Two consequences worth
stating: it can hold a write token in CI where the verifier never can, because it
shares no process with untrusted code; and it cannot leak anything a student
wrote, because it never reads it.

SCORES CARRY WHERE THEY CAME FROM. A claim is not a verdict. Until somebody
re-runs the notebook, a row is `claimed`; an item that can never be re-run is
`unverifiable` and says why; an item nobody has to mark is `handed in`. Printing
"unverified" against work that was fine reads to a student as an accusation, so
the tiers are kept apart.
