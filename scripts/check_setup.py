Run:  uv run bootcamp doctor

Prints a green/red checklist. Every learner should see all green (warnings are
fine) BEFORE their next session. Screenshot the output and post it in the cohort
channel.

THE LAST LINE IS COMPUTED, NOT TYPED. It used to read "See you September 14!"
forever, so from the 15th onward the first thing a learner saw after a
successful install was a date that had already passed -- which reads as software
nobody has looked at since. It now names the next session from the curriculum,
and says something true after the last one.

    FOUND BY A LEARNER ON DAY TWO -- Karol Rojas, in a pull request against the
    cohort repository -- and it is the worst shape an onboarding bug can have:
    every `uv run bootcamp ...` dies with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
    'bootcamp_agent'` BEFORE the doctor that would have explained it gets to run.

    uv marks what it installs into `.venv` hidden on macOS, and `site.py` skips
    a hidden `.pth` -- including the editable-install one that points at `src/`.
    So the package never reaches `sys.path`, on a machine where nothing is
    actually wrong.

    Clearing the flag alone only fixes the NEXT process, because `site.py` has
    already run by the time this does. Re-adding the directory puts the package
    on `sys.path` for this run too, which is what makes the doctor self-healing
    rather than merely informative.

    A no-op anywhere without `os.chflags`, which is everywhere but macOS.
