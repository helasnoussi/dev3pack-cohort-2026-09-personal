"""Generate docs/notebook-index.md: what every notebook is, and where it starts.

TRANSPORT ONLY. Everything here is READ OUT OF THE NOTEBOOKS. The goal line, the
exercise ids and the opening code example are extracted, never retyped, because
a hand-written index of forty notebooks is stale the first time somebody edits
one and nobody notices for a month.

WHAT EACH ENTRY CARRIES, and why those three things:

    guidance     the notebook's own Goal line, so a learner can tell from the
                 index whether this is the one they want
    explanation  what it teaches and what it costs them, in the notebook's own
                 words rather than a summary of them
    a start      the first real code cell, so the index answers "what does this
                 actually look like" without opening anything

The preflight and the import cell are skipped when choosing that example: every
notebook opens with the same four lines, and printing them forty times would
tell a reader nothing.
