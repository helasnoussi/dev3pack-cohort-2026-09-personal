TWO REPOSITORIES, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS STAGED.

    source   this repo. Private, yours, everything, CI. Where you work.
    student  Gecko-Academy/dev3pack-cohort-2026-09. Read-only for the cohort.
             Contains only what has been released.

Nothing is hidden by a permission. Week 2 is simply not in the student repo
until you publish it, so there is nothing to leak and nothing to administer per
student. Access is granted once, at enrolment.

WHY A SCRIPT RATHER THAN A COPY BY HAND. Two exclusions are easy to forget and
expensive to get wrong:

  - `tests/test_checks.py` runs every checker against its SOLVED value. It is a
    literal answer key for all fifteen sessions.
  - an unreleased `units/en/session-NN-*/` is the staging itself.

So this refuses to publish rather than trusting anyone to remember. The refusal
is the product; the copying is incidental.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST, stated plainly: the repository is MIT
licensed, and a student who has week 1 may redistribute it. This is a speed bump
against a cooperating cohort, not a control. It stops accidents, not people.
