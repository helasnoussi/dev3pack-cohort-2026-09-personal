"""Generate the table of contents and the course index from the curriculum.

    uv run python scripts/course_site.py --check    # CI: fail if anything is stale

ONE ORDERING SOURCE. The course is data in `bootcamp_agent.curriculum`, and this
renders it into the two files people navigate by:

    units/en/_toctree.yml   the table of contents, in the Hugging Face course
                            shape: one group per unit, `local` paths under
                            `units/en`, titles read from each page's heading
    docs/course-index.md    the human index: dates, checks, and what runs in CI

It also owns one managed block at the end of every unit's `introduction.mdx`,
between `navigation:start` and `navigation:end` markers, so every unit has a
Previous and a Next that cannot go stale. Everything outside the markers is the
author's.

IT ALSO REFUSES. A unit directory with no `introduction.mdx`, a notebook
without its solutions, a page nobody can reach from the table of contents, or
a directory the curriculum does not know: each is a problem `--check` reports,
because a page that exists and is unreachable is the failure this layout was
adopted to end.
