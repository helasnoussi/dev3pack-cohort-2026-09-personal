"""Generate the Dev3Pack curriculum-entry sheet — the fields, in fill-in order.

    uv run python scripts/dev3pack_entry.py            # markdown + csv
    uv run python scripts/dev3pack_entry.py --xlsx     # also the workbook
    uv run python scripts/dev3pack_entry.py --check    # CI: fail if stale

THREE FORMATS, ONE SOURCE. The markdown is for reading beside the form; the CSV is
one row per form action in fill order, for anyone who would rather work down a
spreadsheet; the workbook is the same rows with the columns sized to be read.

THE CSV COSTS NOTHING. `csv` is stdlib, so it is written on every run and CI checks
it like the markdown. The workbook needs `openpyxl` and is therefore opt-in, behind
the `spreadsheet` extra — the same discipline as `certificate`. Pandas would be
fifty megabytes to do what thirty lines of stdlib already do, in a repository every
learner runs `uv sync` on.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Dev3Pack's curriculum builder is a form: per module, a lesson
title, lesson content in markdown, a resource title and URL, one or more exercise
titles, and a module resource. Fifteen sessions times those fields is the kind of
transcription a person does once, wrongly, at 1am. This renders every field from
the curriculum, in the order the form asks for them, so the job is copy and paste
rather than recall.

IT LINKS TO THE COHORT REPOSITORY, NOT THIS ONE. A student following a link from
Dev3Pack must land on something they can actually open, and the source repo is
private to us. A session that has not been published yet still gets its link —
the URL is correct the moment its week opens, which is also when anyone will
click it.

GENERATED, SO IT CANNOT DRIFT. A retitled session or a renamed exercise changes
here on the next run, and `--check` fails the build if someone edits the output
by hand instead.
