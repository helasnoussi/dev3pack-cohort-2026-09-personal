"""Re-run a submitted notebook and say whether its claimed score holds.

    uv run python scripts/verify_submission.py submissions/octocat/ch03

A submission is a CLAIM plus its EVIDENCE. The claim is `submission.json`; the
evidence is the notebook beside it. This script makes the claim falsifiable: it
copies the submitted notebook into the course tree, runs it with the checks
non-strict, and compares what the notebook's own `check()` calls printed against
what the file says they printed.

WHY COPY RATHER THAN RUN IN PLACE. A chapter's notebook resolves its imports and
fixtures relative to the course, so `units/en/session-03-structured-outputs/notebook.ipynb`
is the only path at which chapter 3 can run. Copying is what lets somebody
else's notebook be judged by our harness rather than by their environment.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It proves the notebook in the pull
request produces the results claimed for it. It cannot prove how much help was
taken, because the hint database never leaves the learner's machine, and help
only ever costs marks, so nobody gains by over-reporting it.
